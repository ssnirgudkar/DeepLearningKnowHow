Frequently Asked Questions:

What is deep learning?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning which in turn is a subset of artifical intelligence. In classical machine learning, the data scientist has to decide which features he/she is interested in and have to hand code or extract these features from the dataset. In deep learning, the algorithm or the architecture does this job for you. There is no need to extract the features. Hence the process becomes significantly less laborious.

What is CNN?
CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Network. This is one of the most popular architecture in Neural Network. It is extensively used in image domain. It is based on a convolution operator/filter which is extensively used in classical image processing.

Why deep learning is so popular?
In 2012, Geoffrey Hinton's group achieved groundbreaking performance on ImageNet dataset. The won the annual competition of object classification by a huge margin. They had used deep CNN to achieve this performance. It showed the world how to model what happens in a neuron at a very basic level. However, it lit up the computer vision community and people started experimenting with the architecture - modifying it in several ways and getting very good results. The only requirement was (is) to have a labeled dataset. This requirement is not easy to meet but not impossible either. A lot of problems were reframed so as to be amenable to deep learning approach. Like an old saying, 'to a man with a hammer, everthing looks like a nail', people try to convert every problem to deep learning problem but it is not always right.

Which problems cannot be solved by deep learning?
Deep learning at its heart is an optimization problem. If one's problem cannot be formulated as an optimization problem then it is not a good candidate for deep learning. Problem involving heavy numerical computation such as encryption, graph related algorithms, calculating trajectory of missles etc. cannot be formulated as deep learning problems.
